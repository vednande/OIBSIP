        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Lal Bahadur Shastri was the second Prime Minister of independent
          India. He studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish
          Chandra High School, which he left to join the non-cooperation
          movement. Lal Bahadur Shastri was a very simple man who worked for the
          betterment of the country. He led the country successfully through
          Indo-Pakistan War in 1965. He popularized the slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai
          Kisan’, recognizing the need for self-sustenance and self-reliance as
          the pillars to build a strong nation. Shastri tackled many elementary
          problems like food shortage, unemployment and poverty. To overcome the
          acute food shortage, Shastri asked the experts to devise a long-term
          strategy.
